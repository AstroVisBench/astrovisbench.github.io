We introduce **AstroVisBench,** the first benchmark for both scientific computing and visualization in the astronomy domain.
**AstroVisBench** judges a language model’s ability to both: 
- Create astronomy-specific workflows to process and analyze data **(Processing)** 
- Visualize the results of these workflows through complex plots **(Visualization)** 


We use the following metrics evaluate LLMs using this benchmark along these dimensions:
- **Processing No Error %:** This is the percent of processing task responses that executed without crashing. *(Higher is better)*
- **VIscore:** This is the Variable Inspection score, indicating how well successfully executed generated code is able to create data products that match those created by the ground truth. *(Higher is better)*
- **Visualization No Error %:** This is the percent of visualization task responses that executed without crashing. *(Higher is better)*
- **VisFail %:** This is the percent of visualization task responses that failed to follow instructions and generate only one visualization. *(Lower is better)*
- **Visualization Errors (CorrectV, MiE, MaE):** This is the breakdown of **Correct/No Errors,** **Minor Errors,** and **Major Errors** in the set of LLM-generated visualizations as determined through our automated LLM-as-a-judge method. *(Higher CorrectV is better)*

We present the results of evaluating several LLMs on **AstroVisBench** below in an interactive leaderboard.
If you would like to test your models on this benchmark, you can find the code to execute and evaluate model responses in our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SebaJoe/AstroVisBench).
